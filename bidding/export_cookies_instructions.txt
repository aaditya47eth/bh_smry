HOW TO EXPORT COOKIES FOR LOCAL AUTHENTICATION
==============================================

If you cannot use the CHROME_PROFILE_DIR method (e.g., because you want to keep your main browser open while the bot runs), you can use a cookies file.

1. Install a cookie export extension like "EditThisCookie" or "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY".
   (Be careful with extensions; uninstall them after use).

2. Log into Facebook on your regular browser.

3. Open the extension and export cookies for facebook.com.
   - Ensure you export as JSON format.

4. Paste the content into a file named `cookies.json` in this project's root folder.

5. In your `.env` file, make sure `CHROME_PROFILE_DIR` is blank.

6. Run the bot. It will load these cookies into Puppeteer.

Note: Cookies expire. If the bot stops working, you may need to re-export fresh cookies.
