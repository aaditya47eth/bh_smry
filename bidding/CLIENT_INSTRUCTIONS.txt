   FACEBOOK AUCTION SCRAPER - CLIENT GUIDE
==============================================

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Node.js installed (https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer)
   - Download the "LTS" version for Windows.
   - Install it (just click Next > Next > Finish).

SETUP:
1. Unzip the "bidding" folder to your Desktop or Documents.
2. Open the folder.
3. Make sure there is a file named ".env" with the correct settings.
   - If you don't see it, ask your developer for the file.
   - It contains the connection keys to the database.

HOW TO RUN:
1. Double-click the "run.bat" file.
2. A black window (terminal) will open.
   - On the first run, it will install some files (takes 1-2 mins).
   - Then it will say "Server running..." and "Polling Supabase...".
3. Keep this black window OPEN. Minimize it, but don't close it.

HOW TO USE:
1. Go to your Admin Panel website.
2. Go to the "Auction" tab.
3. Paste the Facebook Post URL you want to track.
4. Click "Start Tracking".
5. The black window on your computer will open a Chrome browser and start reading comments.
   - DO NOT close that Chrome window manually.
   - You can minimize it.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If the black window closes immediately, something is wrong. 
- Try running it again.
- If it says "Login required", the Chrome window might pause. You can manually log in to Facebook in that window if needed, but usually it uses saved cookies.

STOPPING:
- To stop, just close the black window.
